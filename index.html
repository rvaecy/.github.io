                        &emsp; Hey, good evening. I hope you’re doing well. This thoughts has been im my mind for a while, and I wanted to share it. I don’t usually do this, but something in you made me to do it. You’re kindness, sweet soul, the way you carry yourself, and the presence you have. It quietly drew me in. And honestly i’m already thankful that you know my name. I didn’t like you because of your looks, but I fell in love with you because of who you are. I love how you carry yourself with grace and confidence, how kind and genuine you are to everyone you meet, and how you put God at the center of your life. And I love your gentleness, I fell in love with the real Eustacie the one who is beautiful not just on the outside, but in every little thing you do, and I can’t help but be drawn to the incredible heart that is uniquely yours.

I know you are kind of person who is successful in life, our life is different you are a model and im a normal being person, you make made me wants to be same level as you. and whats the point of thinking that you’ll give me a chance but im willing to take a risk and wait for you. I’m willing to take this step and court you, gently and patiently, if you’d allow me. And if your answer is no, its totally okay. Im willing to accept everything!
